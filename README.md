# RecruitAI

RecruitAI is a self-hosted Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that scores and ranks resumes against a job profile instead of just keyword-matching them. It's a MERN app (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) that uses Google Gemini for resume parsing and skill embeddings, and a scoring engine that runs entirely on the Node server - no separate ML microservice.

The goal was to build something closer to how a hiring team actually thinks about a resume: which skills matter most for this specific role, whether a candidate's experience backs up their claimed skills, and how confident the system is when it says "this person is a good match."

## What it actually does

**Resume parsing.** PDFs are uploaded and text is pulled out with `pdf-parse`. If a resume comes back with almost no extractable text (a scanned resume, for example), the app falls back to sending the raw PDF bytes to Gemini directly instead. Gemini returns a fixed JSON structure: name, email, normalized skill tags (categorized as Language / Framework / Tool / Practice / Soft-Skill), years of experience, degree, field of study, a short summary, and a quote from the resume for each skill it detected, so a claimed skill isn't taken at face value.

**Gold-standard benchmarking.** Instead of manually guessing at ideal weights, you can upload up to 12 resumes of people who already succeeded in the role. The server parses all of them, averages their years of experience, finds the most common degree and field, and tallies which skills show up across the group. Any skill appearing in at least a quarter of the resumes gets added to the job's skill list automatically, with its importance tier set by how common it was (75%+ of resumes = Must-have).

**Semantic skill matching.** Skills aren't matched by exact string comparison. Both the job's required skills and each candidate's skills get embedded with Gemini's `text-embedding-004`, and matches are decided by cosine similarity with a 0.82 threshold. That means a job requiring "kubernetes" will still credit a resume that only says "k8s" or "container orchestration," rather than missing it on a technicality.

**Weighted scoring.** Each candidate gets three component scores - Experience, Skills, Education - combined using whatever weights the job config has set (40/40/20 by default, adjustable per job). Missing a Must-have skill disqualifies the candidate outright regardless of overall score. Every match or miss is logged individually with the score effect it had, so the final number is never a black box.

**Radar chart.** The server renders a small SVG radar chart per candidate (returned as a base64 data URI, no client-side charting library needed) comparing the candidate's Experience/Skills/Education/Field profile against the benchmark.

**Self-tuning weights.** When an HR reviewer rates a candidate from 1-10, the system nudges the weight of every skill that candidate had, using a simple online update with a decaying learning rate (so weights stabilize as more ratings come in for that skill). Must-have skills are floored at a weight of 80 so they can't be tuned away entirely. Every change is pushed onto a version history array first, so a job config can be rolled back one step if a tuning pass makes things worse.

**Multi-reviewer ratings.** More than one HR user can rate the same candidate; the stored `hr_rating` is the average across all of them, so one reviewer's opinion can't dominate.

**Duplicate detection.** New uploads are checked against existing candidates (per job owner) by email or case-insensitive name match, and flagged rather than silently rejected.

**Keyword-stuffing detection.** Gemini flags resumes that are mostly a long unstructured list of skills with no supporting context, which shows up as an authenticity flag on the candidate.

**Bring-your-own API key.** Each user supplies their own Gemini API key on first login rather than the app using a single shared key. It's encrypted with AES-256-CTR before being stored and only decrypted server-side when a request needs it.

**Pipeline tracking.** Candidates move through New, Screening, Interview, Offer, and Rejected stages directly from the dashboard.

**Leaderboard and reset.** A "Top Performers" panel shows the 10 highest-scoring candidates. A one-click reset wipes all candidates and job configs for the current user to start a role from scratch.

## Tech stack

**Client:** React 18 (Vite), React Router, Tailwind CSS, Axios, lucide-react

**Server:** Node.js, Express 5, MongoDB with Mongoose, JWT auth (`jsonwebtoken` + `bcryptjs`), Multer (in-memory storage, no files ever touch disk), `pdf-parse`

**AI:** `@google/generative-ai` - Gemini 2.5 Flash for resume parsing/extraction, `text-embedding-004` for skill embeddings

There is no separate Python or Flask service. All scoring logic (cosine similarity, weighted aggregation, the online weight-tuning update, and SVG generation for the radar chart) lives in `server/services/mlService.js` and runs in-process alongside the API.

## Getting started

You'll need Node.js 18+, a MongoDB instance (local or Atlas), and a Google Gemini API key (free to generate at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)).

### Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `server/`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=any_long_random_string
ENCRYPTION_KEY=must_be_exactly_32_characters
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

`ENCRYPTION_KEY` has to be exactly 32 characters - it's used directly as an AES-256 key and the server will refuse to start otherwise. `GEMINI_API_KEY` here acts as a fallback; each user can also save their own key from the app after logging in, which is what actually gets used per-request.

```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The client expects the API to be reachable per the base URL configured in `client/src/services/api.js`.

## How a job actually gets set up

1. Create a job config (`New Job Config` in the nav bar) - either fill in experience/degree/field and add skills manually, or upload a handful of resumes from people who've already done well in the role and let the app derive the benchmark and skill weights for you.
2. Upload candidate resumes. Each one gets parsed, checked for duplicates, and embedded.
3. Run a prediction on a candidate to get its score, disqualification status, and explainability breakdown against the currently active job config.
4. Rate candidates as you review them. Ratings feed back into the skill weights automatically, so the config gets a little more accurate the more you use it - with a version history you can roll back if a change doesn't help.

## API overview

All routes except `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` require a `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

## Notes

- Uploaded resumes are kept in memory only during the parse (Multer memory storage) - nothing is written to disk on the server.
- The `demo_resume` folder has seven sample PDFs, useful for trying out the benchmark upload flow without needing real resumes on hand.
- There's no license file in this repository yet, so treat the code as all-rights-reserved until one is added.
